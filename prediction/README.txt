BIO REACTOR SENSOR PREDICTION USING LSTM

The code presents a solution using LSTM to predict the behavior of the sensors generated by the BioReactor (temperature, pressure, humidity and oxigen).

INFRASTRUCTURE
Python 3
	running in a virtual environment with the libs from REQUIREMENTS.TXT installed
MONGODB server with the sensors values

DESCRIPTION
The project contains a configuration file to connect to the MONGODB server. The file is located at the REACTOR_CONFIG folder.
The necessary dataset for training the model must be located in the DATASETS folder as a CSV file following the columns
	["date, temperature, pressure, humidity, oxigen"] values
The resultant trained LSTM model will be saved in the TRAINED_MODEL folder for further usage if necessary

EXECUTION
First execute the "dataset_prep_mongo" script.
The script is very straight forward and it basically reads all collections from the MONGODB and creates a training dataset

Second execute the "lstm_training" script.
This script will consume the dataset produced from the MONGODB and will train a LSTM model for prediction.
When it is trained, it will produce some validation images and save the model for further usage.
