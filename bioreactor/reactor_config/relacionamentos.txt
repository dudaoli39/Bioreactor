**** OPTIMAL VALUES FOR EACH SENSOR AND IMPACTS OF VARIATION *****
------------------------------------------
Summary of Optimal Bioreactor Conditions
Parameter	Optimal Range
Temperature	25–37°C (depends on organism)
Pressure	1.0–1.2 atm (1–1.5 bar)
Humidity	>80% RH
Dissolved Oxygen (DO)	20–60% (depends on organism)
------------------------------------------

1. Temperature (°C)
Bacteria (E. coli, Bacillus, etc.) → 30–37°C
Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) → 25–35°C
Fungi (Aspergillus, Penicillium, etc.) → 20–30°C
Mammalian Cells (CHO, HEK, etc.) → 35–37°C
Plant Cells → 22–28°C
📌 Key Considerations:
Too high → Enzyme denaturation, cell death
Too low → Slow metabolism and growth

2. Pressure (atm or bar)
Typical operating range: 1.0–1.2 atm (1–1.5 bar)
High-pressure bioreactors (for gas fermentation or deep-tank reactors): Up to 3 bar
📌 Key Considerations:
Too high → Shear stress, oxygen toxicity, foam formation
Too low → Poor oxygen transfer, reduced cell growth

3. Humidity (%)
Gas supply (air, oxygen, or CO₂) should be humidified to prevent drying effects.
Optimal air humidity: Above 80% RH (relative humidity).
📌 Key Considerations:
Too low → Evaporation from culture medium, increased osmolality
Too high → Condensation on sensors, potential contamination risks

4. Dissolved Oxygen (DO, % saturation)
Bacteria (E. coli, Bacillus, etc.) → 30–50% DO
Yeast and fungi → 20–40% DO
Mammalian cells (CHO, HEK, etc.) → 40–60% DO
Anaerobic organisms (Clostridium, Lactobacillus, etc.) → 0% DO
📌 Key Considerations:
Too high → Oxygen toxicity, oxidative stress
Too low → Anaerobic conditions, reduced energy production



**** RELATIONSHIPS AND IMPACT RATES *****

------------------------------------------
Summary Table: Impact Rates
Change in Parameter	Effect on Other Parameters	Approximate Impact Rate
↑ Temperature	↓ Oxygen Solubility	↓ 10–15% per 10°C
↑ Temperature	↑ Evaporation (↓ Humidity)	↑ 7% water loss per 10°C
↑ Pressure	↑ Oxygen Solubility	~100% per 1 atm increase
↑ Pressure	↓ Evaporation (↑ Humidity)	↓ 5–10% per 1 atm
↑ Agitation (RPM)	↑ Oxygen Transfer Rate	~50–80% per 2× RPM
↑ Oxygen Flow	↑ Pressure (if not vented)	Proportional to gas input
------------------------------------------

1. Temperature vs. Oxygen Solubility 🌡️🆚🫁
For every 10°C increase in temperature, oxygen solubility decreases by ~10–15% (in water).
Example:
At 20°C, O₂ solubility ≈ 9.1 mg/L
At 30°C, O₂ solubility ≈ 7.5 mg/L (↓~17%)
At 40°C, O₂ solubility ≈ 6.4 mg/L (↓~15%)
📌 Impact: Higher temperatures make it harder for cells to access oxygen, requiring more aeration/agitation.

2. Pressure vs. Oxygen Solubility ⚖️🆚🫁
Oxygen solubility increases linearly with pressure (Henry’s Law).
Every 1 atm (bar) increase in pressure → ~100% increase in O₂ solubility.
Example:
At 1 atm (1 bar) → O₂ solubility ≈ 7.5 mg/L (at 30°C).
At 2 atm (2 bar) → O₂ solubility ≈ 15 mg/L.
At 3 atm (3 bar) → O₂ solubility ≈ 22.5 mg/L.
📌 Impact: High pressure can improve O₂ transfer but also increases shear stress and foam formation.

3. Temperature vs. Humidity 🌡️🆚💧
For every 10°C increase in temperature, air holds ~7% more water vapor.
If gas is not humidified, increasing temperature causes higher evaporation from the medium, altering concentrations.
📌 Impact: Temperature increases lower humidity, which increases evaporation, leading to medium concentration changes.

4. Pressure vs. Humidity ⚖️🆚💧
Increasing pressure suppresses evaporation → Helps maintain humidity.
Every 1 atm increase in pressure reduces evaporation rate by ~5–10%.
📌 Impact: High pressure reduces water loss, but if too high, it can cause dissolved gas imbalances.

5. Oxygen vs. Agitation (OTR – Oxygen Transfer Rate) 🫁🆚🔄
Doubling agitation speed (RPM) can increase O₂ transfer rate by ~50–80%.
However, above a certain speed, shear stress damages cells (especially mammalian cells).
📌 Impact: Oxygen transfer is enhanced by agitation but must be optimized to avoid cell damage.
